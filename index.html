        <p>Music doesn’t get in. Music is already in. Music simply uncovers what is there, makes you<br> feel emotions that you didn’t necessarily know you had inside you, and runs around waking<br> them all up. A rebirth of sorts.</p>

    <h4>BLUE - Billie Eilish</h4>
    <p>“Blue,” the album’s melancholic closing track that most fans already know is a rework of previously unreleased and leaked song, “True Blue.” Now, Eilish has opened up about the complicated story behind the making of the track, which she says involved a mash-up of, not just one, but two songs, and was only inspired after “True Blue” had leaked online.</p>
